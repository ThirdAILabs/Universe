# Note that neither of these tests check what happens when we don't activate.
# at all. This is because these tests are running in CI with a valid license
# file accessible and when we fall back to the license file method it will still
# work. However, the fact that test_file_licensing.py passes, which includes bad
# license file checks, shows that when we don't activate Keygen we do indeed
# fall back to license files.
