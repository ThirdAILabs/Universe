SPECIFICATIONS (FOR V1, SEPTEMBER 24)

LOADERS
    The INVARIANT of loaders:
    - The output string must only contain:
        - spaces (just the space character; exclude tabs, newlines, etc.)
        - lowercase letters
        - numbers
    - Load string from a file based on queue (manages which file in the queue is being read)

 1. LoaderHelper:
    - cleanUpString()
        - Converts non-newline whitespaces to space
        - Converts uppercase letters to lowercase
        - Removes every character that is not a letter, a number, space, or sentence ending punctuations
        - No stemming

 2. SentenceLoader:
    - Loads a sentence from a file
    - Cleans up string (call cleanUpString())
    - Sentences are delimited using ending punctuations (.?!); we do NOT consider edge cases such as:
        - '.' is a part of an ellipsis
        - '.' at the end of initials

 3. ParagraphLoader:
    - Loads a paragraph from a file
    - Cleans up string (call cleanUpString())
    - Removes ending punctuations.
    - Assumes a line is a paragraph; we do NOT consider edge cases such as:
        - Each line is just a bullet point

 4. FileLoader:
    - Loads all text from a file into a single string
    - Cleans up string (call cleanUpString())
    - Removes ending punctuations and newline characters.
    

VECTORIZERS
    The INVARIANT of vectorizers:
    - Shifts vector indices by start_idx.
    - Fits all indices into max_dim indices.
    - If dimension < max_dim, then don't rehash.

 1. TriGramVectorizer
    - Fills 'indices' vector with character trigram token ids
    - Fills 'values' vector with the frequency of each token id (no idf / global frequency)
 2. UniGramVectorizer
    - Fills 'indices' vector with word unigram token ids
    - Fills 'values' vector with the frequency of each token id (no idf / global frequency)
 3. BiGramVectorizer
    - Fills 'indices' vector with word bigram token ids
    - Fills 'values' vector with the frequency of each token id (no idf / global frequency)
    

DATASET
 1. StringDataset
    - Loads string using one of the loaders
    - Passes it to all three vectorizers and assembles their products into one vector
    - Formats into batches
