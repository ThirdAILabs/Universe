This repository is a customized version of the SymspellCPP project (https://github.com/AtheS21/SymspellCPP), originally based on https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell v6.5. In our project, we have made several modifications and optimizations to tailor it to our specific needs.

### Introduction
SymspellCPP is a C++ port of the original SymSpell project, designed to perform spell-checking and correction tasks. Our customized version includes additional features, such as serialization and minor changes to incorporate our clang-tidy requirements. So, we maintained it seperately rather than adding it as a dependency.

Please note that you can disable/enable unicode support by the macro #define UNICODE_SUPPORT in the header Symspell.h
