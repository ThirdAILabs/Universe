For running the distributed bolt, first we need to start a ray cluster

First install all the required module by running the following command(to be done on all the node):
        - Have the Distributed bolt module built on those node 
        - Run the command: python3 install_required_module.py
        - Check if ray path is included in system path by printing (run 'echo $PATH' on terminal)
                Ray's default path is /home/$USER/.local/bin
                If not included, run the command: export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/.local/bin
        
Automatic Cluster Initialization:
        For starting the ray cluster automatically:
                - Run the command: python3 start_cluster.py <head_node_ip> <worker_node_ip_1> <worker_node_ip_2> ...
                
                
Manual Cluster Initialization:
        For starting ray cluster manually:
                - On head node, run the command 'ray start --head --port=6379'
                - On worker nodes, run the command 'ray start --address=<head_node_ip>:6379'
               

To check whether cluster have started run command on terminal 'ray status'
        - If the number of cpus id equal to (no. of ips)* 48 => cluster is setup

Once cluster is started to start training
        Importing the library
        - from thirdai.distributed_bolt import DistributedBolt


        The current APIs supported:

        -        head = DistributedBolt(1 /** number of workers you want to use, should be less than or equal to the number of ips in the cluster**/, config_filename/** configuration file **/) 

        -        head.train(False/** True=> circular communication or False=> Linear Communication**/) Prefer Linear Communication for usage upto 3 nodes.
        
        -        print(head.predict()) /**Return is same as network.predict()**/

Look at train_distributed_amzn670k.py for sample code.

IMPORTANT
1. head_node_ip should be the first input of ray cluster
2. Make sure you have the Distributed_Bolt_V1 branch is built on everynode(head node and worker node) you are running.
3. Set up password less ssh between nodes(for easier usage)
