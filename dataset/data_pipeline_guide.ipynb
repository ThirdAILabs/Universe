    "\n",
    "This notebook is a guide for DataPipeline, a configurable streaming dataset loader. DataPipeline's core functionality is to convert each row of a tabular dataset into a vector that Bolt can understand. What makes DataPipeline unique is that it allows you to configure what features to extract from a dataset and how to encode them as vectors. We do this by using what we call \"blocks\", objects that read specific columns of each row in a dataset and adds a feature segment to the row's corresponding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's take a look at an example use case. First, we generate a mock dataset. Each row of this dataset has two comma-delimited columns. The first column contains a class ID and the second column contains a sentence. This is typical of a text classification dataset, where the task is to predict the class ID from the given text."

However, this can be useful in cases where we don't know how to best encode features for a new dataset or task. We can try different combinations of features without writing new data processing scripts, without recompiling C++ code after each iteration, and with the speed of a C++ implementation."
