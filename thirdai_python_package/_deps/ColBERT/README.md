This is a modified version of ColBERT, https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT,
specifically the cpu_inference branch as of March 27 2022. See the LICENSE
file for the license information of the original code.

Currently you can download the model from the ColBERT authors and use 
colbert_wrapper.py by first running ./download.sh. However, this is a hack and we
intend to host this ourselves later.
