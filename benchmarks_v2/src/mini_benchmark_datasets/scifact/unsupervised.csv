0,microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.,alterations of the architecture of cerebral white matter in the developing human brain can affect cortical development and result in functional disabilities. a line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (mri) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient  to calculate relative anisotropy  and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). to assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development  early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. in the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high  1.8 microm2/ms  and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. in the posterior limb of the internal capsule  the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms  p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter  10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%  p = 0.001; internal capsule  24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor mri as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. the data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor mri provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.
1,induction of myelodysplasia by myeloid-derived suppressor cells.,myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective hematopoiesis. here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc)  which are classically linked to immunosuppression  inflammation  and cancer  were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of mds patients and played a pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. these clonally distinct mdsc overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic progenitors. using multiple transfected cell models  we found that mdsc expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule s100a9 with cd33. these 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that recruited components to cd33’s immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim)  inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf-β by immature myeloid cells. s100a9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow accumulation of mdsc accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. importantly  early forced maturation of mdsc by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif–bearing (itam-bearing) adapter protein (dap12) interruption of cd33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. these findings indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of mdsc driven by the s100a9/cd33 pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of mds.
2,bc1 rna  the transcript from a master gene for id element amplification  is able to prime its own reverse transcription.,id elements are short interspersed elements (sines) found in high copy number in many rodent genomes. bc1 rna  an id-related transcript  is derived from the single copy bc1 rna gene. the bc1 rna gene has been shown to be a master gene for id element amplification in rodent genomes. id elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. the retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. these regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue  transcript stability  priming of the rna transcript for reverse transcription and integration. this study focuses on priming of the rna transcript for reverse transcription. bc1 rna gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. this self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. the observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a rna capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the bc1 rna gene as a master gene for amplification of id elements.
3,the dna methylome of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells,dna methylation plays an important role in biological processes in human health and disease. recent technological advances allow unbiased whole-genome dna methylation (methylome) analysis to be carried out on human cells. using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing at 24.7-fold coverage (12.3-fold per strand)  we report a comprehensive (92.62%) methylome and analysis of the unique sequences in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from the same asian individual whose genome was deciphered in the yh project. pbmc constitute an important source for clinical blood tests world-wide. we found that 68.4% of cpg sites and <0.2% of non-cpg sites were methylated  demonstrating that non-cpg cytosine methylation is minor in human pbmc. analysis of the pbmc methylome revealed a rich epigenomic landscape for 20 distinct genomic features  including regulatory  protein-coding  non-coding  rna-coding  and repeat sequences. integration of our methylome data with the yh genome sequence enabled a first comprehensive assessment of allele-specific methylation (asm) between the two haploid methylomes of any individual and allowed the identification of 599 haploid differentially methylated regions (hdmrs) covering 287 genes. of these  76 genes had hdmrs within 2 kb of their transcriptional start sites of which >80% displayed allele-specific expression (ase). these data demonstrate that asm is a recurrent phenomenon and is highly correlated with ase in human pbmcs. together with recently reported similar studies  our study provides a comprehensive resource for future epigenomic research and confirms new sequencing technology as a paradigm for large-scale epigenomics studies.
4,the human myelin basic protein gene is included within a 179-kilobase transcription unit: expression in the immune and central nervous systems.,two human golli (for gene expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage)-mbp (for myelin basic protein) cdnas have been isolated from a human oligodendroglioma cell line. analysis of these cdnas has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human golli-mbp gene. the golli-mbp gene  which encompasses the mbp transcription unit  is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons  seven of which constitute the mbp gene. the human golli-mbp gene contains two transcription start sites  each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. at least two golli-mbp transcripts  containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more mbp exons  are produced from the first transcription start site. the second family of transcripts contains only mbp exons and produces the well-known mbps. in humans  rna blot analysis revealed that golli-mbp transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus  spleen  and human b-cell and macrophage cell lines  as well as in fetal spinal cord. these findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen mbp in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the golli-mbp gene. they also establish that this genetic locus  which includes the mbp gene  is conserved among species  providing further evidence that the mbp transcription unit is an integral part of the golli transcription unit and suggest that this structural arrangement is important for the genetic function and/or regulation of these genes.
5,targeting a20 decreases glioma stem cell survival and tumor growth,glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (gscs). gscs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. we determined that a20 (tnfaip3)  a regulator of cell survival and the nf-kappab pathway  is overexpressed in gscs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mrna and protein levels. to determine the functional significance of a20 in gscs  we targeted a20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin rna (shrna). inhibiting a20 expression decreased gsc growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/rela. elevated levels of a20 in gscs contributed to apoptotic resistance: gscs were less susceptible to tnfalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells  but a20 knockdown sensitized gscs to tnfalpha-mediated apoptosis. the decreased survival of gscs upon a20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. the tumorigenic potential of gscs was decreased with a20 targeting  resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. in silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that a20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. together these data indicate that a20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. although inactivating mutations in a20 in lymphoma suggest a20 can act as a tumor suppressor  similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact  our data suggest a20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of gsc survival. a20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type.
6,efficient targeting of expressed and silent genes in human escs and ipscs using zinc-finger nucleases,realizing the full potential of human embryonic stem cells (hescs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hipscs) requires efficient methods for genetic modification. however  techniques to generate cell type–specific lineage reporters  as well as reliable tools to disrupt  repair or overexpress genes by gene targeting  are inefficient at best and thus are not routinely used. here we report the highly efficient targeting of three genes in human pluripotent cells using zinc-finger nuclease (zfn)–mediated genome editing. first  using zfns specific for the oct4 (pou5f1) locus  we generated oct4-egfp reporter cells to monitor the pluripotent state of hescs. second  we inserted a transgene into the aavs1 locus to generate a robust drug-inducible overexpression system in hescs. finally  we targeted the pitx3 gene  demonstrating that zfns can be used to generate reporter cells by targeting non-expressed genes in hescs and hipscs.
7,empirical bayesian models for analysing molecular serotyping microarrays,background microarrays offer great potential as a platform for molecular diagnostics  testing clinical samples for the presence of numerous biomarkers in highly multiplexed assays. in this study applied to infectious diseases  data from a microarray designed for molecular serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae was used  identifying the presence of any one of 91 known pneumococcal serotypes from dna extracts. this microarray incorporated oligonucleotide probes for all known capsular polysaccharide synthesis genes and required a statistical analysis of the microarray intensity data to determine which serotype  or combination of serotypes  were present within a sample based on the combination of genes detected. results we propose an empirical bayesian model for calculating the probabilities of combinations of serotypes from the microarray data. the model takes into consideration the dependencies between serotypes  induced by genes they have in common  and by homologous genes which  although not identical  are similar to each other in sequence. for serotypes which are very similar in capsular gene composition  extra probes are included on the microarray  providing additional information which is integrated into the bayesian model. for each serotype combination with high probability  a second model  a bayesian random effects model is applied to determine the relative abundance of each serotype. conclusions to assess the accuracy of the proposed analysis we applied our methods to experimental data from samples containing individual serotypes and samples containing combinations of serotypes with known levels of abundance. all but two of the known serotypes of s. pneumoniae that were tested as individual samples could be uniquely determined by the bayesian model. the model also enabled the presence of combinations of serotypes within samples to be determined. serotypes with very low abundance within a combination of serotypes can be detected (down to 2% abundance in this study). as well as detecting the presence of serotype combinations  an approximate measure of the percentage abundance of the serotypes within the combination can be obtained.
8,bayesian measures of model complexity and fit,summary. we consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pd for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. in general pd approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of fisher's information and the posterior covariance  which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. its properties in exponential families are explored. the posterior mean deviance is suggested as a bayesian measure of fit or adequacy  and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. adding pd to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models  which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. the procedure is illustrated in some examples  and comparisons are drawn with alternative bayesian and classical proposals. throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a markov chain monte carlo analysis.
9,simplifying likelihood ratios,likelihood ratios are one of the best measures of diagnostic accuracy  although they are seldom used  because interpreting them requires a calculator to convert back and forth between “probability” and “odds” of disease. this article describes a simpler method of interpreting likelihood ratios  one that avoids calculators  nomograms  and conversions to “odds” of disease. several examples illustrate how the clinician can use this method to refine diagnostic decisions at the bedside.
