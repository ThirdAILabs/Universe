# Explanations (if you can figure out how to get these in line be my guest):
# abseil-*: 
#    We want all abseil checks, if we get any of these
#    we should start using abseil (see the CMakeLists.txt
#    for a commented out way to do this)
# bugprone-reserved-identifier: 
#    Violating reserved identifiers is undefined behavior, not good
