# TODO: Add more

# Explanations (if you can figure out how to get these in line be my guest):
# abseil-*: 
#    We want all abseil checks, if we get any of these
#    we should start using abseil (see the CMakeLists.txt
#    for a commented out way to do this)
# bugprone-*, -bugprone-narrowing-conversions:
#    We want all the bugprone checks, but we turn off the one for narrowing
#    conversions because it is annoying.
# cert-*-cpp, -cert-err58-cpp, -cert-msc50-cpp:
#    It is good practice to follow the c cert recommendations, but err58 is 
#    flagged by google test macros, and we don't care about the limited 
#    randomness of rand() called out by cert-msc50-cpp or warning about 
#    random seeding from cert-msc51-cpp
# cert-*-c, -cert-err34-c, -cert-msc30-c, -cert-msc32-c:
#    We don't care about limited randomness or seeds (cert-msc30-c, -cert-msc32-c),
#    TODO: Add back cert-err34-c, it is good, just requires non trivial code changes
#
