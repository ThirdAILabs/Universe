"Maternally contributed mRNAs and proteins control the initial stages of development following fertilization. During this time, most of the zygotic genome remains transcriptionally silent. The initiation of widespread zygotic transcription is coordinated with the degradation of maternally provided mRNAs at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). While most of the genome is silenced prior to the MZT, a small subset of zygotic genes essential for the future development of the organism is transcribed. Previous work in our laboratory and others identified the TAGteam element, a set of related heptameric DNA-sequences in the promoters of many early-expressed  Drosophila  genes required to drive their unusually early transcription. To understand how this unique subset of genes is regulated, we identified a TAGteam-binding factor Grainyhead (Grh). We demonstrated that Grh and the previously characterized transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld) bind to different TAGteam sequences with varying affinities, and that Grh competes with Zld for TAGteam occupancy. Moreover, overexpression of Grh in the early embryo causes defects in cell division, phenocopying Zld depletion. Our findings indicate that during early embryonic development the precise timing of gene expression is regulated by both the sequence of the TAGteam elements in the promoter and the relative levels of the transcription factors Grh and Zld.",79000
"Blood ammonia and glutamine levels are used as biomarkers of control in patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs). This study was undertaken to evaluate glutamine variability and utility as a predictor of hyperammonemic crises (HACs) in UCD patients. 
 
 Methods 
 The relationships between glutamine and ammonia levels and the incidence and timing of HACs were evaluated in over 100 adult and pediatric UCD patients who participated in clinical trials of glycerol phenylbutyrate. 
 
 
 Results 
 The median (range) intra-subject 24-hour coefficient of variation for glutamine was 15% (8–29%) as compared with 56% (28%–154%) for ammonia, and the correlation coefficient between glutamine and concurrent ammonia levels varied from 0.17 to 0.29. Patients with baseline (fasting) glutamine values >900 µmol/L had higher baseline ammonia levels (mean [SD]: 39.6 [26.2] µmol/L) than patients with baseline glutamine ≤900 µmol/L (26.6 [18.0] µmol/L). Glutamine values >900 µmol/L during the study were associated with an approximately 2-fold higher HAC risk (odds ratio [OR]=1.98; p=0.173). However, glutamine lost predictive significance (OR=1.47; p=0.439) when concomitant ammonia was taken into account, whereas the predictive value of baseline ammonia ≥ 1.0 upper limit of normal (ULN) was highly statistically significant (OR=4.96; p=0.013). There was no significant effect of glutamine >900 µmol/L on time to first HAC crisis (hazard ratio [HR]=1.14; p=0.813), but there was a significant effect of baseline ammonia ≥ 1.0 ULN (HR=4.62; p=0.0011). 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 The findings in this UCD population suggest that glutamine is a weaker predictor of HACs than ammonia and that the utility of the predictive value of glutamine will need to take into account concurrent ammonia levels.",454290
"Purpose: 
 Large-scale array-based and sequencing studies have advanced our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders, but also increased the potential to generate an exponentially larger amount of clinically relevant findings. As genomic testing becomes more widespread in psychiatry research, urgency grows to establish best practices for offering return of results (RoR) to individuals at risk or diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. 
 
 
 Methods: 
 We interviewed an international sample (n=39) of psychiatric genetics researchers to examine conceptualizations of “best practices” for RoR to individual research participants. 
 
 
 Results: 
 While the vast majority of researchers do not offer RoR, most believed medically actionable findings (85%) and clinically valid but non-medically actionable findings (54%) should be offered. Researchers identified three main areas for improvement: interfacing with individual participants; interdisciplinary training, guidance, and integration; and quality planning and resource allocation for returning results. 
 
 
 Conclusion: 
 There are significant gaps between researchers’ visions for “best” versus “actual” RoR practices. While researchers call for participant-centered practices, including consent practices that consider any special needs of participants with psychiatric disorders, return of individually meaningful results, and effective follow-up and provisions for treatment, the current reality is that consent and RoR practices lack standardized and evidence-based norms.",679273
"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated serum glucose levels and altered lipid metabolism, due to peripheral insulin resistance and defects of insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells. While some cases of obesity and Type 2 diabetes result from genetic dysfunction, the increased worldwide incidence of these two disorders strongly suggest that the contribution of environmental factors such as sedentary life-styles and high-calorie intake may disrupt energy balance. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its upstream kinase LKB1 are conserved serine/threonine kinases regulating anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes, therefore representing attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes. In this review, we will discuss the advantages of targeting the LKB1/AMPK pathway for the treatment of metabolic diseases.",317494
"Background 
 For breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the method of margin assessment that most frequently achieves negative margins without increasing volume of tissue excised is uncertain. We examined our institutional experience with 3 different margin assessment methods used by 6 experienced breast surgeons. 
 
 
 Methods 
 Patients undergoing BCS for invasive carcinoma during July-December of a representative year during which each method was performed (Perpendicular, 2003; Tangential, 2004; Cavity-Shave, 2011) were included. Effect of margin method on positive margin rate at first excision, and total volume excised to achieve negative margins, were evaluated by multivariable analysis, by surgeon, and by tumor size and presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC). 
 
 
 Results 
 555 patients were identified: Perpendicular, 140; Tangential, 124; Cavity-Shave, 291. Tangential method had a higher rate of positive margins at first excision than Perpendicular and Cavity-Shave methods (49%, 15%, 11%, respectively; p<0.0001). Median volumes to achieve negative margins were similar (55ml, Perpendicular; 64ml Tangential; 62ml Cavity-Shave, p=0.24). Four of 6 surgeons had the lowest rate of positive margins with Cavity-Shave method—significant when compared to Tangential (p<0.0001), but not Perpendicular (p=0.37). Comparison of volume excised using the 3 methods was variable by surgeon (p<0.0001). Perpendicular method was optimal for T1 tumors without EIC; Cavity-Shave tended to be superior for T2/3 tumors and/or EIC. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 While the Cavity-Shave method may decrease rates of positive margins, its effect on volume is variable among surgeons and may result in an increase in total volume excised for some surgeons, and for small tumors without EIC.",276857
