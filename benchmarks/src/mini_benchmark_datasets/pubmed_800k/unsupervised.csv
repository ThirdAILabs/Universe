 Assessment of cognition and everyday function is essential in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Two novel measures of cognition (No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS)) were designed to have robust psychometric properties and reduced practice and ceiling effects. This study aims to evaluate if the NPE and CFAS demonstrate stronger psychometric properties and reduced practice effects compared with established measures, including the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). 
 
 
 Methods: 
 This parallel group, four-site study will randomize 320 cognitively intact adults aged 60 to 85 years to novel or well-established measures of cognition and function. All participants will receive assessments at baseline (week 0), 3-months, and 12-months, as well as a brain MRI scan and Apolipoprotein E genetic test at study entry. Analyses will determine psychometric properties of the NPE and CFAS, compare the sensitivity of measures to AD risk markers, and identify cognitive domains within the NPE. 
 
 
 Discussion: 
 Practice effects have been a major limitation of Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials that typically assess cognitive changes over serial assessments. Detection of functional impairment in cognitively normal individuals with biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease requires instruments sensitive to very subtle functional changes. This study is intended to support the validation of two new composite measures, the NPE battery and the CFAS, which may advance clinical testing of interventions for individuals across the spectrum of early stage Alzheimer’s disease.","2"
